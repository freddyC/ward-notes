========

This is just a simple little game where a bar moves left to right and
you have to push space bar when you are within the given range.  We did
this as a mid term for a Game Dev class I was in.  We were given 4 hours
to complete it.

Here are what the requirments were and their points values:

 * Functionality: 30
 * Particle Effect: 10
 * Sound: 10
 * Visual Appeal: 10
 * Ease of Use: 10
 * Input Abstraction: 10
 * High-Scores: 10
 * Game State: 10

The only thing I didn't finish was the Particle Effects.
